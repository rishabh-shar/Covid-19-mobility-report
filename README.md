# Covid-19-mobility-report
This project I have done because it tries to understand the behaviour of people who are living in my native state of himachal pradesh. 
This gives a graphical representation of where people are going in the state of lockdown. 
Also in this project we also covered which state is behaving the most responsible and which state is behaving the least responsible.

# Conclusion
Graphs which we see here gives us a picture of how Covid-19 changed the lifestyle and choices of people living in himachal pradesh.
Also the 2nd part of the project shows that in jammu and kashmir people were very less responsible than other states.
