# Covid-19-mobility-report
This project I have done because it tries to understand the behaviour of people who are living in my native state of himachal pradesh. 
This gives a graphical representation of where people are going in the state of lockdown. 
Also in this project we also covered which state is behaving the most responsible and which state is behaving the least responsible.

# Goal
The main goal of the project is to analyze the covid-19 data in a more graphical manner and try to see the behaviour of people in my home state of himachal pradesh as well as people in other states of india.
Almost everyone has been affected by the current coronavirus pandemic in one shape or another.
This project shows the effect of the pandemic in a visual aspect.

# Motivation
As I was stuck at home due to the situation and didn't had anything to do but looking continuously at the continuous growth of cases of covid-19 all over the world.
I was feeling so unproductive and useless. So I decided to do a data science project on the pandemic. Previously I had many ideas and different data sources in my eye to work with.
I also did some work on them but when I find this data I was very excited about it and wanted to put on my github profile.

# Conclusion
Graphs which we see here gives us a picture of how Covid-19 changed the lifestyle and choices of people living in himachal pradesh.
Also the 2nd part of the project shows that in jammu and kashmir people were very less responsible than other states.
